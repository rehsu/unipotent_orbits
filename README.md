# unipotent_orbits
### This Python package is used for 
- Visualizing and computing the basic properties of classical root systems, i.e. of types $A_n, B_n, C_n$ and $D_n$. Exceptional cases are not included.

- Visualizing and computing the basic properties of unipotent orbits attached to classical reductive groups.

- Visualizing the weyl groups of classical groups.
